  <h1 align = "center" class = "c1">Bhilwara</h1>
  <h2 align = "center"></br></br>Famous as the ‘city of textiles and looms’, Bhilwara is home to the world renowned Ramdwara of Ramsnehi Sampraday. The founder Guru of the Sampraday, Swami Ramcharanji Maharaj, preached to his followers here and later decided to move to Shahpura. The present day headquarters of the Ram Snehi Sampraday, known as Ram Niwas Dham are located in Shahpura.

Some people say that Bhilwara got its name from the Bhils (tribal people) who lived there during the days of yore. As per a story, the city of Bhilwara had a mint that minted coins known as ‘bhiladi’. This is supposedly the origin of the district’s name. Bhilwara's cultural history can also be traced back to the Nagar Brahmins mentioned in the Skanda Purana. </h2>
